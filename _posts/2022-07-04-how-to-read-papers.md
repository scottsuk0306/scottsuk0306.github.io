# How to Read Papers by Andrew Ng

Main content for this blog will be the summary of papers I read related to Computer Science. But before I start reading the papers, I wanted to make a guideline for myself on how to `correctly` read papers. So, I had watched [Andrew Ng’s Career Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI) video and summarizing it here for myself in the future and for anyone who are just beginning to read a research paper.

# How to read papers on specfic field

Let’s assume we’re trying to read papers to learn Speech Recognition.

- First, make a list of papers to read. List can include not only research papers but also medium or blog posts.
- Skim through the list of papers.
  - Read several papers at a time. Quickly scan (about 10%) of all papers.
  - Some papers might worth reading while other papers are not. Then, take some time to carefully understand the content of the worthy paper.
  - Add refereced papers in that worthy paper in the list.
  - Repeat the process.

In general, if you read 15-20 papers, you get a good understanding of any field/topic.

If you read 50-100 papers, you get mastery in the area

# How to read a paper

In the case of Andrew Ng, he always take research papers with him. He does research papers study twice a week (two papers a week) and to select two papers he reads 5~6 papers a week.

It is not a good idea to read from the first word to the last word. Focus on the main idea. Then, look at math.

1. Read Title / Abstract / Figure

   In deep learning field, there are some research papers that try to summarize all contents in one or two figures.

2. Intro + Conclusion + Figure + Skim rest (Skim related work)

   Publishing a paper is a procedure to prove this paper is good enough to be accepted by reviewers. So, authors write the introductiona and conclusion very carefully for reviewers.

3. Read but skip, skim math
4. Read all but skip the part you can’t understand.

   Even the papers with highest citations have unimportant parts.

5. Try to answer the following questions. Share your answers with others.
   - **What did authors try to accomplish?**
   - **What were the key elements of the approach?**
   - **What can you use yourself?**
   - **What other references do you want to follow?**
